# SolarIQ
## A Simple, Intuitive tracking and monitoring site for solar panel efficiency and maintenance.
- Estimates Power Capturing efficiency of panels given panel data and location.
- Highlights potential issues with panel/PV system
- Suggest potential remedies/actionable steps for care and maintenance

# How it works:
1. Uses historical data from [NASA's Data Access Viewer](https://power.larc.nasa.gov/data-access-viewer/) to determine the potential solar power available in a given location.
2. Accepts csv input for the measured power generated a solar panel/PV system. See csv format details.
3. Accepts location of solar panel/PV systen with address or latitude-longitude
4. Outputs a comparison chart, efficiency estimate, potential issues and recommended actions for care and maintenance.
