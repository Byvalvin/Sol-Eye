2. Enter a suitable .csv file containing power data for the solar panel/PV system. [Instructions for .csv files]()
3. Click the *Upload CSV* button to get the chart for the solar panel/PV system.
4. Enter the latitude and longitude(or the address to get the latitude and longitude) of the location of the solar panel/PV system.
5. Click the *Get Solar Data* button to get the chart for the available solar power in the given location. This gives a visual comparison of the solar power available and the solar power captured by the solar panel/PV system.
6. Click the *Compare* button to get a recommendation based on the provided data.

## Key points
- Getting Solar is the longest step in the process. It takes ~30 secs to complete(some patience is necessary here).
- The process can be repeated for new csv files. If a new .csv file is added, the *Upload CSV* button should be clicked again to use the new .csv file.
- Once the solar data for a location is gotten once, there is no need to retrieve it again unless the location is changed.
