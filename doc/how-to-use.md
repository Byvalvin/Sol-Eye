## Instructions
1. Go to [SolarIQ](https://sol-eye.onrender.com/){:target="_blank"}
2. Enter a suitable .csv file containing power data for the solar panel/PV system. [Instructions for .csv file formatting](https://github.com/Byvalvin/Sol-Eye/blob/main/test/notes.txt).
3. You may use [this](https://github.com/Byvalvin/Sol-Eye/blob/main/test/Dust%20problem.csv?raw=true) .csv with this location *8515 112 ST NW* to test. More testing information [here](https://github.com/Byvalvin/Sol-Eye/blob/main/test/notes.txt).
4. Click the `Upload CSV` button to get the chart for the solar panel/PV system.
5. Enter the latitude and longitude(or the address to get the latitude and longitude) of the location of the solar panel/PV system.
6. Click the `Get Solar Data` button to get the chart for the available solar power in the given location. This gives a visual comparison of the solar power available and the solar power captured by the solar panel/PV system.
7. Click the `Compare` button to get a recommendation based on the provided data.

## Key points
- Getting Solar Data is the longest step in the process. It takes ~30 secs to complete(some patience is necessary here).
- The process can be repeated for new csv files. If a new .csv file is added, the `Upload CSV` button should be clicked again to use the new .csv file.
- Once the solar data for a location is gotten once, there is no need to retrieve it again unless the location is changed.
- This is a showcase site, so initial loading of the site may take 1-2 mins.
